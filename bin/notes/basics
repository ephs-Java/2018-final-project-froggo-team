Welcome to the Final Project
or this year called the dix-sept-erledigt.

After you figure out what you are going to be doing, 
--and who is part of your squad, 
--create groups on git and
--get to learning and planning

Create some goals and milestones in git.

I would like to connect you with a programmer from the wild.
So, I need to know what you are thinking, and have a paragraph description of your project to share.
We have a draft to match mentors and groups, so make it compelling.

if (start) {
			car.add(new Rectangle(WIDTH + width + car.size() * 300, HEIGHT - height - 590, width, height));
			car.add(new Rectangle(WIDTH + width + (car.size() - 1) * 300, HEIGHT - height - 120, width, height));
		} else {
			car.add(new Rectangle(car.get(car.size() - 2).x + 600, HEIGHT - height - 590, width, height));
			car.add(new Rectangle(car.get(car.size() - 2).x, HEIGHT - height - 120, width, height));
		}
